# this.codereview
<h3>in progress..</h3>

This.codereview is a managment app designed specificaly for code reviews. 
My insipration for the design came from my terminal with Oh My Posh cmd. 

The background design for the body and the wrappers for the elements is transperent glass.
Breadcrumbs command line is fully dynamic and expended/reduced based on actual routing. 
There is more to come, this is just a tase...
